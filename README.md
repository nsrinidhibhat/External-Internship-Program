# External Internship Program (EIP)

EIP was a co-learning internship that I have been a part of, with the help of which I now have a good grasp on Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Nets.
Here are all the Colab python notebooks for Deep learning projects and Convolution Neural Networks, ordered by all the sessions.

*Legend*:
- Session 1: Basic Techniques of Edge Detection from an Image Processing perspective, before delving right into CNNs.
- Session 2: A transition from a non-ideal way of creating a sequential operations of CNNs on an image, to an ideal one.
